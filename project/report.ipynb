    "\n",
    "Questions that interests us:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Regions with the highest number of charging stations\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Top 10 cities with the highest number of charging stations\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Distribution of charging station types\n",

    "4.Average power capacity of charging stations\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Average power capacity of charging stations by region\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Number of charging stations per operator\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to answer these questions following steps were followed:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data collection -  The first step was to gather the necessary datasets for analysis. The two datasets, Germany E-charging stations and E-Ladesäulenregister, were obtained from their respective sources. The data was available in different formats, including CSV and XLSX.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Preprocessing: Before proceeding with analysis, data was preprocessed and cleaned by steps such as handling missing values, removing duplicates and unnecessary rows, standardizing column names, and encoding for German characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data Integration: The datasets were combined based on common fields or identifiers to create a unified dataset. This integration allowed for a comprehensive analysis of the combined data, leveraging the information from both datasets simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Combined Datset was further explored to gain insights into the charging station landscape in Germany. it involved analyzing the data distribution, identifing patterns, and uncovering of meaningful trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Visualization: The findings and results were visually represented using appropriate graphs, charts, and plots. To effectively communicate the insights derived from the analysis and for better understanding of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation and Conclusion: The results and findings from the analysis were interpreted and summarized."
